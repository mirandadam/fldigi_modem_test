# fldigi_modem_test
Test of the performance of FLDIGI modems under different signal propagation conditions.

## Methodology

Modify FLDIGI to accept more macros and modify linsim to accept more command line options.

Whith the modified versions installed:

* Generate WAVs of a test message with each modem using FLDIGI.
* Simulate propagation conditions using linsim.
* Read back the WAVs generated by linsim using FLDIGI and measure how well the message was received.

The modified versions of linsim and fldigi are in https://github.com/mirandadam/fldigi and https://github.com/mirandadam/linsim.

## Caveats

* Tested only on Ubuntu 18.04.1. Results should be valid for any installation that FLDIGI runs on.
* The modifications to FLDIGI and linsim were made with care, but this test suite is very hacky. One needs be willing to code and must have at least a basic grasp of python to play with it. Configuration is made by editing the main .py file.
